# MASSL-segmentation-framework

Multi-task Attention-based Semi-supervised Learning framework for image segmentation based on the paper published at MICCAI 2019 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12303) by Shuai Chen, et al.

For questions please contact me through github or email directly.

## Requirements
1. python 3
2. matplotlib
3. numpy
4. SimpleITK
5. sklearn
6. pytorch, torchvision
7. tqdm
8. skimage
9. scipy
10. elasticdeform

## Training steps
1. Prepare 3D data for training, validation, and testing. Set the image patch size in module/common_module.py [BraTSshape]. Set folder path, preprocessing, and save as .npy files in BraTS2018_preprocess.py.
2. Set dataloader for pytorch, data split, and data augmentation in dataloader/BraTS18_dataloader.py.
3. Set random data seed, job you want to run, and data split you want to test in Sequance_BraTS18_epoch.py [for CNN baseline, pretraining methods, and MSSL method], or Sequance_BraTS18_epoch_attention.py [for MASSL method]. 
4. Run Sequance_BraTS18_epoch.py or Sequance_BraTS18_epoch_attention.py for training.

## Testing
Change variable [Test_only=True] in Sequance_BraTS18_epoch.py or Sequance_BraTS18_epoch_attention.py and run again.
